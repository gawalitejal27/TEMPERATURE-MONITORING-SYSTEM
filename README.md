# TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This project implements a Temperature Monitoring System using an Arduino Uno and a temperature sensor to continuously measure temperature. The sensed temperature is processed by the microcontroller and displayed in real time on an LCD .The system demonstrates the practical use of sensor interfacing, ADC conversion, and embedded system programming.
